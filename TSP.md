## üß≠ **Classic TSP (Overview)**
- **Goal**: Visit all cities exactly once and return to the starting point with minimum cost.
- **NP-Hard**: No polynomial-time solution for large N.
- **Approach**: DP with Bitmasking, Branch and Bound, or Approximation.

---

## üîÄ **TSP Variations**

### 1. **Classic TSP (Return to Origin)**
- **Requirement**: Must return to the starting city.
- **Approach**: DP + Bitmask  
- ‚úÖ Leetcode-style: Not directly available, but custom implementations exist.  
- üîß DP State: `dp[mask][i]` = min cost to reach `i` with visited cities in `mask`.

---

### 2. **Asymmetric TSP**
- **Description**: Cost from city A to B ‚â† cost from B to A.
- üß† Think: Real-world roads with one-way paths or different costs in each direction.
- üîß Same approach (bitmask DP), but with a non-symmetric cost matrix.

---

### 3. **TSP without Return (Hamiltonian Path)**
- **Description**: Visit all cities once, but don't need to return.
- ‚úÖ **Leetcode 847 ‚Äì Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes**  
  - Graph-based version of TSP (unweighted).
  - Solve with BFS + Bitmask.

---

### 4. **TSP with Constraints (Limited Fuel, Visitation Rules)**
- üß© Variation: Can't go to a node unless prerequisites met or cost ‚â§ budget.
- ‚úÖ **Leetcode 943 ‚Äì Find the Shortest Superstring**  
  - TSP variation with strings. Overlap of strings = path cost.
  - Solve using DP + Bitmasking.

---

### 5. **Multiple Travelling Salesmen (mTSP)**
- **Description**: More than one salesman; each handles a subset of cities.
- **Used in**: Logistics, delivery planning, drone routing.
- ‚úÖ Not on Leetcode directly; seen in operations research.
- üß† Split cities into `m` groups & solve TSP individually or cooperatively.

---

### 6. **Prize Collecting TSP**
- **Description**: Visit cities to collect rewards. Not all cities are mandatory.
- **Goal**: Maximize prize ‚Äì cost, or meet a minimum threshold.
- ‚úÖ Similar to **Leetcode 1293 ‚Äì Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination**

---

### 7. **TSP with Time Windows**
- **Description**: Must reach each city within a given time window.
- üïì Often used in delivery services (e.g., reach between 2 PM‚Äì4 PM).
- ‚úÖ Custom implementation only. Closest: VRP solvers like OR-Tools.

---

### 8. **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)**
- **Extension of TSP**: Multiple vehicles, capacity constraints, depot return.
- ‚úÖ Not on Leetcode; Google OR-Tools has real-world datasets & solvers.

---

### 9. **TSP with Pickups and Deliveries**
- **Description**: Some nodes require you to pickup first, then deliver.
- ‚úÖ Real-world: Courier services, ride-sharing apps.
- ‚úÖ Similar concepts in **Leetcode Pickup and Delivery Problems**.

---

### 10. **TSP with Revisit Allowed (Relaxed TSP)**
- **Description**: You may revisit cities, or nodes multiple times.
- ‚úÖ Leetcode 847 variation can be adjusted this way.
