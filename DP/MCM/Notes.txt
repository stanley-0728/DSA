This is the toughest Pattern  Matric chain Multiplication / Partition Dp.

Whenever you are givin that u need to solve in a particular way / pattern.
e.g (1+2)+(3*5) = 16 or (1+2+3)*5 = 30 you see if i solve in one way i am getting one answer or in another i am getting another answer. Whenever you see these kind of patterns that's where you need to apply partition DP.

Till now what we were doing in grids 1d 2d stock subsquence and strings and lis we followed a pattern but for this it will be different.

For every problem in this pattern you will given array 
i and j are start and end point of the array let us say i=0 and j= len-1
let k be the partition  f(i,j) = f(i,k) and f(k+1,j)

Rules 
1. start with enitre block/array with i and j.
2. Try all partitions.Run a loop to try partitions 
3.Return best two partitions
