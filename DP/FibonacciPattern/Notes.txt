How do you convert recursion into tabuluation(Bottom up)


Always go from base case  to the requried ans which is bottom up.
Go from required answer to base case which top down in recursion which we followed.

Always in recursion whatever dp array you are using intialize it first. So for fibo we can see dp[0] =0;dp[1]=1;
Now you need to check at what values you can start considering your base is set and till what value you can go.

Then you look for recurence relationship just copy up everything instead of function replace it with dp.


Now can you optimize the space further .
Whenever you find i-1 and i-2 just see the pattern in fibo also we require only previous two elements so why are we using an array over here . If you two varaibles to store last two previous values and keep over riding let prev1 and prev2 and i is running when i reaches n+1 and prev is at n and prev2 is at n-1 so your answer lies in prev.


So for the all the problems we would be seeing previous and current for space optimatization.


How did you find dp problems .
Coun no of ways 
do something and find min or max output 
whenever try out all possible ways comes in 
either we need to count or give best output use recursion


Rules 
1. Always try to represent problem in terms of index
2. Do possible stuff on that index according to problem statement.
3. Sum up all stuff Count all ways.
Minum all stuff .
