There are Certain Patterns in Dp .
Fibonacci Patterns
SubSet Patterns
Grid Patterns
Longest Common SubSquences 
longest Increase SubSquences
Matrix Chain Multiplication 
String Patterns

In all the patterns we will follow three rules 
first we go with recursion we follow three rules over there 
calculate time complexity and space complexity 
Then do memozization over there.

With this we can do tabuluation and then space optimatization.
